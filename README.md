## SUMMARY

Having recently arrived from France, I currently reside in Montreal and hold an open work permit. 
I have prior experience serving as a tech lead for small teams of developers, overseeing a maximum of five individuals thus far. 
My primary interest lies in the product methodology and the impact of the solutions developed, rather than the specific technologies employed, as long as they are relevant to effectively solving the problem at hand. 
Ideally, I would like to work for a software publisher or an end-customer with a presence in Montreal that also offers remote working opportunities.
